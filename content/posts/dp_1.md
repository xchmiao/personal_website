# Context
I used to be pretty intimidated by dynamic programming (DP). Every time I saw those recursive formulas or multi-dimensional DP tables, I wanted to run for the hills.

Yet, during the winter break, I found myself knee-deep in dynamic programming problems—one after going through tens of DP problems. 

In this (my very first!) blog post, I’d like to share the “aha!” moments with DP starting from the most classic Knapsack problems: **0/1 and Unbounded Knapsack**. I hope it spares you at least a few hair-pulling moments if you’re about to dive into the wacky world of DP!

For the rest, I'll cover:

1. Recap what **0/1 and Unbounded Knapsack**
2. The four essential elements of a DP algorithm
3. Sample code snippets that show how to apply this DP framework in practice
