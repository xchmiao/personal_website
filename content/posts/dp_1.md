# Fun Fact
I used to be pretty intimidated by dynamic programming (DP). Every time I saw those recursive formulas or multi-dimensional DP tables, I wanted to run for the hills.

Yet, during the winter break, when a friend asked me for help tackling her coding interviews, I found myself knee-deep in dynamic programming problems—one of the most “why-do-I-need-this?” and hair-pulling categories out there. Ironically, what started as a favor turned into a surprisingly fun flavor. 

In this (my very first!) blog post, I’ll share the “aha!” moments I had while unraveling two of the most classic Knapsack problems: **0/1 and Unbounded Knapsack**. Here’s hoping it saves you from a few headaches as you tackle these on your own! Let’s get started.
